## Manifold Sample Project (Maven, IntelliJ)

Utilize a small sampling of core Manifold features to demonstrate the
structure of a basic project using Manifold. Use the `pom.xml` file as a
template for your own project.

Play with this in IntelliJ IDEA using the <b>Manifold</b> plugin:

```
File | Settings | Plugins | Browse Repositories | Manifold
```

Use features such as: Navigation, Code completion, Find Usages, Rename Refactor, Move Refactor, Go To Declaration, etc.
